Erl8583 provides Erlang modules and functions for packing and unpacking ISO 8583 messages in several formats: ASCII, binary, XML, JSON and EBCDIC. A generic marshalling module is provided for implementing other encoding schemes.

The library has been tested with packing schemes used by jPOS, Postilion, iso8583py and American Express.

The user guide (available as a PDF on the "Downloads" page) is a good place to start. The user guide gives an introduction to ISO 8583, describes Erl8583 and its installation and dependencies and includes 8 examples.
